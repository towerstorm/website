										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past week and a half I&#8217;ve been without internet or a working PC, and painful as that was it I still managed to get a bunch of work done on Tower Storm. The biggest improvement is in Bot AI, they now build all towers and minion types and have a more sane algorithm than just &#8220;Build ALL the towers!&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be posting about the rest of the changes soon, stay tuned and enjoy! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>P.S. you can now assign bots to other teams, setting up a 3 vs 3 game and watching them battle it out is so much fun, the image today is from a 3 vs 3 war I played recently with them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Not much has changed in the gameplay department over the past few days as this morning I noticed the server was at 100% cpu load and almost all ram was consumed. So I&#8217;ve been profiling and debugging the server fixing memory leaks and speed issues with the game to try and get it lower as in theory the server should be able to handle hundreds of players, it&#8217;s simply a matter of optimizing it enough.Â </span></p>
<p>Next up after this is improving the bots AI as well as some UI improvements to make the game more intuitive. Things such as showing the routes of your minions and your opponents minions and only allowing players to build towers on their own side of the map.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bots are live! Sure they don&#8217;t do much yet, they only build 3 towers then spam you with a basic minion whenever they can until either you or they die. But since when has that ever stopped me releasing something (scrappy is good right? ;)) It should be fairly obvious how to add them to <a href="/2013/everything-went-better-than-expected-bots-are-live/" class="more-link">[&#8230;]</a>]]></description>

<p>It should be fairly obvious how to add them to your game, simply click the big Add Bot button.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be making them build towers, send different types of minions and allow you to change their teams over the next few days.</p>
<p>I thought it would be multiple days to get the core game code separated out into another project, turns out it only took one, then another few days to get the build process up and running again. I had 3 friends leaving Brisbane last weekend so not much work was done which is why this update is a little bit later than expected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR &#8211; Servers are fine, I need more time to get bots going.</p>
<p>Today I realized to make the bots work they&#8217;re going to have to load up a copy of the game code and run it as if they were a real player to make decisions. I was going to do a fuzzy simulation of the game in the bot code so they could guess where Towers should be placed and when to send minions but as the game evolves and gets more and more complex this is going to get completely out of hand.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve had to move the core game logic out in to aÂ separateÂ project that is shared between the game server and the bots so they play together nicely. This means that the code is currently in a very broken state and it&#8217;s going to be at least another couple of days until the game is completely split into a separate module and then a few more days until bots are working.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy more of Johnny&#8217;s awesome art and play some team games! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If anyone&#8217;s interested in the process of sharing code between multiple NodeJS Apps I&#8217;ll be doing a post on my personal blog (http://www.timjrobinson.com)/ soon. I felt it makes more sense to put it there as most of the readers of this site are not programmers and just want to play Tower Storm not learn of the wizardry behind it.</p>
