										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you everyone who sent in feedback now that the contact form is fixed, we really appreciate it! Unfortunately I discovered yesterday that email addresses weren&#8217;t being sent through with the form so I have no way to actually respond to your questions. Thus i&#8217;ve decided to answer them here instead:</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: #222222;"><strong>Dieter Schulte</strong> &#8211;Â </span><span style="color: #222222;">Hey I love this game, you guys have done a wonderful job! My friends and I were wondering if you were planning on adding a matchmaking system of some sort. even if it doesn&#8217;t have a rating system attached to it?</span></p>
<p><em>Hell yes! We&#8217;ve been wanting matchmaking for so long ourselves and you&#8217;ll be happy to know we&#8217;re just putting the finishing touches on the matchmaking system right now. It has a rating system and you can also find matches as a team of 2 or 3 too so you can play with your friends against others all over the world. It will also feature a ladder of the best Tower Storm players so we can see who the best player in the world really is.Â </em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>David &#8211;Â </strong><span style="color: #222222;">Â I love this game but am sad to see there is no matchmaking at all. Would love to see this as a feature if it&#8217;s still being updated.</span></p>
<p><em>Ok ok, we&#8217;ll stop making you sad. Matchmaking will be available next patch! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Â </em></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #222222;">Alexia</span></strong> &#8211;Â <span style="color: #222222;">I found your game, played the tutorial and accidentally managed to bug it to get stuck. Basically I upgraded my first crossbow tower a few times, so by the time the tutorial told me to build a second tower the first one managed to kill it before I built the second. Now it just keeps telling me to build another crossbow even though I have! Hope you can fix it.</span></p>
<p><em>Thanks for letting us know Alexia. We&#8217;ll get this fixed in the next release.Â </em></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #222222;">Chris Collins</span></strong><span style="color: #222222;">Â </span></span>&#8211;Â <span style="color: #222222;">FREE all-in-one Home Security System</span></p>
<p><i>Oh Chris, little do you know how useless a home security system is when droids and ice elementals have rocked up at your door.Â </i></p>
<hr />
<p>The bug with emails not coming through has been fixed too, so if you send anything through the contact form in the future I&#8217;ll be able to email you back <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
