										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It feels good to get rid of that old piece of junk I used to call a lobby. The new one features 3 vs 3 battles emphasizing that Tower Storm is supposed to be a team game, locking in your choice of race so the host doesn&#8217;t start without you, descriptions of each tower for each race, and being able to kick players / bots from the game.</p>
<p>Let me know if you find anything confusing or have suggestions to improve it. I love to hear your thoughts and ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>June has brought an explosion of creativity for Tower Storm. It&#8217;s the first time the servers have been scaling and completely stable in a while so we could really drill into the gameplay and UI to tweak and refine over and over.</p>
<p><strong>New smaller more fun levels</strong></p>
<p>The first major change is to the level sizes. You&#8217;ll notice both maps are a lot smaller and have much more going on. We discovered through trial and error that many users were confused at the massive PvP map and also on mobiles and tablets maps that require both vertical and horizontal scrolling are hard to play. So now the game is much more fun to play on iPhone 4/5 and most modern android phones.</p>
<p><strong>Play on your mobile!</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to play Tower Storm on your mobile simply go to <a title="Tower Storm Game" href="http://game.towerstorm.com/">http://game.towerstorm.com/</a> in your mobile web browser and hold it in landscape mode. Please let me know if it does or doesn&#8217;t work on your mobile and what version of android / iOS you&#8217;re running so I can make sure it works flawlessly on all phones. If your phone was released in the last 2 years it should be able to play Tower Storm,.</p>
<p><strong>Sound!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Tower Storm now has sound and music! It currently works on all PC browsers that can play Tower Storm and some mobiles. Sound is an important aspect and I want to make sure it sounds right and adds to the gameplay. We&#8217;re still working on giving you more feedback using sound and visual features when you send minions, or minions die, or you get more income.</p>
<p><strong>Victory Screens</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Having the game freeze with a text message when you win or lose is not a fun experience. Victory / Defeat screens are finally in the game and we&#8217;re working on adding end game stats which gives details on how much gold you earnt, minions you killed and so on so you can take a screenshot and brag to your friends <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Hotkeys</strong></p>
<p>Pointing and clicking your mouse on buttons all day is a boring experience. So we&#8217;ve added hotkeys to tower building and minion sending to make it much more fun (and you can send waves of minions while you&#8217;re still building your tower fortress). The hotkeys for each button are in the top left corner or if you can&#8217;t see them they are QWER for towers and ASDFZXCV for minions (left to right and top to bottom in cost).</p>
<p>Enjoy and as always I love to hear your feedback good or bad, let me know what you think.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You asked for it so we made it, Tower Storm now has a survival mode! This mode is like traditional tower defense where you work with friends to defeat waves and waves of incoming minions and see how long you can last. The map design is based off an old favourite Warcraft 3 map: Burbenog! <a href="/2013/survival-mode-unlocked/" class="more-link">[&#8230;]</a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You asked for it so we made it, Tower Storm now has a survival mode! This mode is like traditional tower defense where you work with friends to defeat waves and waves of incoming minions and see how long you can last. The map design is based off an old favourite Warcraft 3 map: Burbenog!</p>
<p>If you play with friends you&#8217;ll be able to coordinate different towers from different races to have a much stronger fortress but be warned: The enemies get stronger the more players you have on your side.</p>
<p>The map was designed to have a few nice chokepoints, firstly there&#8217;s the 5 x 5 areas in the corners which are great for creating deadly combinations of speed and damage towers. Then there&#8217;s the 3 x 3 points which are perfect for slow and poison towers (and maybe a few gold boosters, everyone loves more gold :)).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also 4 way symmetrical on the outside and 2 way symmetrical in the middle so you&#8217;ll have to adjust your strategy accordingly, should you focus on just one corner or all of them equally? Who knows. Perhaps the high score lists (coming soon will reveal who&#8217;s really amazing at this map and who&#8217;s just a pretender).</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t play with bots in survival mode, but you can play single player andÂ <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Income from kills is shared so don&#8217;t worry about picking the support race, you&#8217;ll get just as much income as your friends.</span></p>
<p>Have a play and let me know what you think. I&#8217;m always interested in any feedback you have to share good or bad.</p>
<p>Survival mode is now the new default mode. If you want to play PvP you still can, simply select PvP mode when you create a new game.</p>
