Was this on a mobile device? There have been some issues where the screen would scroll wrongly and the background would move seperately from the actual in game units. This has been fixed in the next release which will be out in a few hours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[G&#039;Day! Solace,
This question may be a little off-topic, When I was a bit younger around 2004 I believe my stepdad got us this game, where you were on a ship in space that as I remember was like a ring. You built rooms for the creatures/aliens that lived on this ring so they could live. I remember building bedrooms and bathrooms, and while you were setting out the layout for each room it looked like blueprint. More aliens would come to your ring the better your ring was I think. Anyone have an idea about what this game is called?

					<description><![CDATA[I was in the middle of playing this game live, and all of the sudden my controls got all screwed up. I have them both on default. And it still looks up when I aim down and down when I aim up. Why?]]></description>
